\section{Introduction}

\section{Problem 1}

A tank holds 1000 gallons of water, which drains from the bottom of the tank in
half an hour. The values in the table show the volume V of water remaining in
the tank (in gallons) after t minutes.

\begin{tabular}{|l||c|c|c|c|c|c|}
\hline
t(min) & 5   & 10  & 15  & 20  & 25 & 30 \\ \hline
V(gal) & 694 & 444 & 250 & 111 & 28 & 0 \\
\hline
\end{tabular}

a) If P is the point (15, 250) on the graph of V, find the
slopes of the secant lines PQ when Q is the point on the
graph with $t = 5, 10, 20, 25$, and 30.

b) Estimate the slope of the tangent line at P by averaging
the slopes of two secant lines.

c) Use a graph of the function to estimate the slope of the tangent line at P.
(This slope represents the rate at which the water is flowing from the tank
after 15 minutes.)
