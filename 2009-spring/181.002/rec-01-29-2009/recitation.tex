\section{Introduction}

We did examples from the 2.4 section and Quiz 4.

\section{Problem 1}

Excercise 3, section 2.4. Solution is on the page A89.

\section{Problem 2}

Excercise 5:

Sketch the graph of a function that is continuous everywhere except at $x=3$
and is continuous from the left at 3.

Solution: one such function is given in the solution at the page A89.

\section{Problem 3}

Excercise 15. The graph is sketched on the page A90. The function needs to be
rewritten by factoring out the nominator:
$${x^2-x-12\over x+3} = {(x-4)(x+3)\over x+3} = x-4$$
See the solution to Quiz 4 for more information.

\section{Problem 4}

Excercise 21. Given the function $G(t) = \ln(t^4-1)$, find the domain, why the
function is continuous at every number in its domain?

Solution: The logarithm $\ln x$ is defined only for $x>0$. We want the
logarithm to be real, e.g. $\ln(-1)$ is not defined. Otherwise, if you remember
complex numbers, logarithm can be defined for any (complex) number $z=\rho
e^{i\theta}$ as $\ln \rho e^{i\theta} = \ln\rho+i\theta$ and it depends on the
branch cut (you can add any number of $2\pi$ to $\theta$). Anyway, so we need
to determine for which $t$ the expression $t^4-1>0$. There are many ways to do
that, for example we can factor it out: $t^4-1 = (t^2+1)(t^2-1) =
(t^2+1)(t+1)(t-1)>0$, but $t^2+1$ is always positive, so we get:
$$(t+1)(t-1) = t^2-1 >0$$
We can either determine $t$ from the left hand side, or just draw a graph of
$t^2-1$, which is just a parabola shifted down by 1. In any case, we get
$$t\in (-\infty, -1) \cup (1, \infty)$$
Which is also the domain of $G(t)$.

How about the continuity? Every polynomial is continuous and $\ln x$ is
continuous for all $x>0$, so $G(t)$ which is a composition of a logarithm and a
polynomial, is continuous for all $t$ from its domain, e.g. for all
$t\in (-\infty, -1) \cup (1, \infty)$.
